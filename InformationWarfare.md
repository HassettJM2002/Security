## MDO / IO / Joint

### Joint MDO

#### 5 Domains
	Space
		- Altitudes greater than or equal to 100 KM above sea level
		- Space Domains allows Cyberspace
		
	Cyberspace ( Only Non Physical Domains )
		- Dependent on Physical Domains
		- Layers of Cyberspace
			Physical -> switches, routers, other devices
			Logical -> software, connections
			Cyber Persona -> users, the data of the users, ips, things that build up a persona
	
	Air
	Land
	Martime

#### Joint All Domain Operations Concepts
	JADO descibes how we can counter adversaries in all domains during armed conflict
	Keyword JOINT, among the brances and all the domains
	
	JAD Command and Control
		What why how
		what we do 
	
	Competition

	- Forced to Share
	
	- Deparmnet became admin control
	
Operational Control
	Not exactly picture perfect
	
Forces
	- Global force managemnet is the process which allows the secdef to strategically manage the employment of 	force among the CCDRS, this is a 
	- SECDEF assigns forces to CCDRS
	- SECDEF allocates forces to CCDRS
	- SECDEF apportions forces to CCDRS

Unified Commands
	Joint forces are estan;ishjed by goegraphic area or functional basis

GCC are assigned of responsibilitys
	geographic combatant commandersforces can operate wherever they are required to accomplish missions

functional Comtant Commands operate across all geographical Areas

The Power of the IA
	- By U.S Code, each USG agency has unique authorities and responsibilities
	- Under Title 22, the Sec. of State. is resposible for assisting Pres. with foregin policy

## Unified Action and Levels of War

	Levels of Warefare
		Strategic
		Operational
		Tactical
		
## Information Environment Defined
	The information environment is the aggregate of social, cultural, psychologocal, technical, and physical
	factors that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, act upon, and are impacted
	by information
	
### Physical Aspect of the Information Environment
	material characeristics, natural / unnatural
		1) Physical aspects may create constraints and freedoms on the people
		and information systems that operate in it
		2) Physical aspects are critical elements of group identity and impact how groups
		communicate
		
### Informational Aspect of Information Environment
	1) Informational aspects reflect the way that individuals, info, systems, and groups communicate
	2) How they communicate

### Human Aspect of the Information Environment
	Humans aspects are interactions among and between people and the environment and shape human behavior and decision making. THose interationcs aer based on linguisitc, social, cultural, psychologcal and physical elements
	
### Intorduction to Operations in the Information Environment (OIE)
	military actiosns involving integratd employment of multiple information forces to affect drivers of 
	behavior by informing audience; influencing foreign relevant actors; attacking and exploiting relevent
	action informationn, information networks, and infromation systems; and protecting friendly information,
	information networks, and information systems
	
	Information is also a critical military resource
	The join force uses infromation to preform many simultaneous
	
	Elevation of information as a join function impacts all operations and signals a fundemental apprecation for the military role of infromation at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels within todays complex OE
	
	Assessment
	Making adjustments when needed or keep on going if is working
	Dev -> Asses Plan -> collect info -> analyze -> Comm feed ack and recs -> adapt plans
	 
### Organizing for OIE
	Info. forces, builidng blocks of OIE units, trained and equipment to create effects on the IE
	
## Info. forces
	EW, Cyberspace OPS, Psych Ops, Milit Sup Ops, Pub. Affairs, Civil Ops, ...
	
## Jooint Organizaions in OIE
	Help plan and support joint forces
	
## Interagency in OIE
	USG Organizations effective intergration of the appropriate USG organizations will enhance the overall success of join forces operations
	There are multitude of organizations inside and outside DOD that are relevant to join forces management and application of information

### Public Affairs
	focus on OIE core of informing domestic, international, and internal audience
	External publiocs
	
### Civil Military Operations
	Activities that establish, maintain, influence, and exploit relationships between military forces
	inidinous pops, inistu. Effect CMO results in the integration of military and other instruments 
	of national power to achieve commands objectives and US interests
	
### Military Information Support Operations (MISO)
	Planned operations to convey selected infromaton and indicators to foreign audience to infulence their meotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals
	
### Military Deception
	Commanders conduct MILDEC to mislead enemy decision makers and commanders and cause them to take or not take specific actions. The intent is to cause enemy commanders to form inaccurate impressions
about friendly force dispositions, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions
	Deceptions requires a thorough knowledge of the enemy and their decision-making processes
	
#### Combat Camera (COMCAM)
	an essential battlefield infromation resource that support strategic, tactical and opetation mission objectives. As the primary suppliers of operation imagery to siupport battle field infromation
	superioritty, COMCAM documentsation teams will be comvat trained and equiped, quickly deployabkle and 
able to operation in austere and hostile environments
	
#### Cyberspace Operations
	CO employ cyberspace capabilities to achieveobjectives inor through scyberspace
	
#### Space Operations
	The cornerstone responsibilities of military space forces are to preserve freedom of acton, enable join lethality and effectiveness, provide national leadership with independent military operations. Space operatuons integrate offensive and defensive actions to achieve and maintain freedom of actions in SPACE
	
#### Opsec
	Asses the risk to preseving essential ecrecy by identifying the crucial info and inidcators that must be proctedted, asses vuln to adversary collection and iterpretation, idenitfiy possivle opsec countermesaure to mitigate vulnerabilitoles
	
	Because a specified task is to protect our own, information, OPSEC planners require complete situational awareness regarding friendl activites and safeguarding critical information
	
#### Special Technical Operations
	Commanders should deconfl;ict and synchronize other activities wioth STO. STO action officers at CCMD or Service Componenets HQs can provide military and civilian leadership with details infromation related to STO and its conribution to join force operations
	
#### Electromagneitc Spectrum Operations (EMSO)
	JEMSo actions to exploit, attack, protect and mange the electromagnetic environment rely on personnel and systems from EW EMS magnment and intel, space, and cyberspace mission areas
	
#### Keyleader Engagment (KLE)
	Most operatuons require commandsers and other leaders to conduct KLES, talk things out, gain their support, and cultivate them as sources of infromation. Building 


#### Quiz Review -> 0305772 -> 01983157

2 - Seize Initiative
3 - dominate
4 - stabalize 
	
12)  The SECDEF 3A -> assings, aollocates and apportions forces to Combatant Commanders

13) Information Forces are specfically organized, trained, and equiped to create effects in the Infromation Environment

14) Public Affairs INFORMS
	orgnanations focus on the OIE activity of infromaing domsetic internaioal and itnernal audiences

	MISO -> builds repore, influence them

15) The national security act of 1947 created the national military establishmentand prescribed a weak SECDEF

16)  5 Opertional Domains
	Air, land, Martime, Space, Cyberspace
